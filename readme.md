# React Native Course

React Native is a port of React to build native applications on iOS and
Android. It differs from some other cross-platform frameworks in that it uses
native views rather than a webview. JavaScript code is executed in a separate
thread from the UI to ensure animations are smooth and the app stays
responsive.

If you have experience in React, then React Native will seem intuitive. In
fact, the same core JavaScript library is used. React Native just uses a
different renderer than ReactDOM and instead renders to native iOS and Android
components.

## Your mission...

...should you choose to accept it, is building a location-aware weather app.
Display the nearest city name, temperature, description of conditions, and an
icon representing those conditions.

## Setup

The API we'll be using to fetch weather information from is
[weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io/). Accounts can take a few minutes to
provision, so signing up now will ensure it's available when needed.

After signing up, you'll receive an API key in your email. Hang on to this.

## Start with a Snack

[Snack](https://snack.expo.io/) is an in-browser environment for prototyping
React Native applications. Think of it as similar to JSFiddle, but specifically
for React Native. We'll be using this to jump-start our learning experience.

When you arrive, you'll be prompted with a QR code and instructions to install
the Expo app. You can skip this for now, as Snack also provides in-browser
emulators for both iOS and Android.

To enable the in-browser emulator, toggle "Preview", and click "Tap to Play".

Now that your app is running, let's start coding.

## You seem familiar

Right away, you'll notice that the example code looks like a normal React
component, a class extending React.Component. Something's different about the
JSX though. Where are the `<div>` tags?

Because we're not rendering to the browser, we use `<View>` tags that are an
abstraction over iOS's `UIView`, Android's `android.view` (and possibly even
`<div>`!). A View is just a container.


`<Text>` is a component to render text output. Unlike React for web, rendered
text must be placed within a `<Text>` component. It can be thought of as
similar to a `<span>`.

Update the content of the `<Text>` tag to "Hello!" and watch the app refresh to
reflect your change.

```js
<View style={styles.container}>
  <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
    Hello there!
  </Text>
</View>
```

## Now you're styling

React Native doesn't have css files, but instead has a feature called
[StyleSheet](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/stylesheet.html). A
StyleSheet is an object that takes properties similar to css, but using
camelCase instead of dash-case. Styles are then assigned to components through
the `style` attribute. An example already exists within the project.

You can also use inline styles directly in the `style` attribute, but
Stylesheet offers a more performant and organized way of managing styles.
Multiple sets of styles can be applied by passing an array to `style`
(ex: `style={[styles.title, styles.main, {fontSize: 20}]}`).

Change the `color` and `fontSize` properties of the `paragraph` style and watch
the change be reflected in your emulator.

## Fake it 'til you make it

Let's start building our weather app by creating a `Display` component. It will
show four pieces of information. Take them in as props.

- `temperature`
- `description`
- `city`
- `state`

Like any weather app, temperature should be large and prominent.

Within `App`, replace the example JSX with a `Display` component with hardcoded
data.

```js
<View style={styles.container}>
  <Display
    temperature={85}
    description={'Hazy'}
    city={'Provo'}
    state={'UT'} />
</View>
```

## Requesting backup

Still have your [weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io/) key from earlier?
Add it as a variable in the file.

```js
const KEY = 'abc123';
```

We'll start by using Weatherbit's
[postal API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api#!/Current32Weather32Data/get_current_postal)
that will take a zip code and look up the current weather. React Native
provides the standard
[fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch)
for making http requests.

Add a `componentDidMount` to `App` and hit the endpoint including your key.
console.log the response to take a look at what we're getting back.

```js
componentDidMount() {
  fetch(`https://api.weatherbit.io/v1.0/current/postal?country=US&postal_code=84044&units=I&key=${KEY}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json))
}
```

`units=I` returns imperial metrics instead of metric.

**To prevent rate limiting:** replace `https://api.weatherbit.io` with `https://weatherbitproxy-hbpqeytmef.now.sh`, a cached proxy of weatherbit's API.

## Getting real

After knowing the shape of the response, it can be used to show real data in
the `Display` component.

The response has a `data` array with only one item in it. Wrap that and set it
to state.

```js
.then(json => {
  this.setState({
    current: json.data[0]
  });
});
```

Now that actual weather data is in state, it can be used within the `App`
`render` method. Wire up the `Display` props.

```js
<Display
  temperature={this.state.current.temp}
  ...
  />
```

## Picture this

Weatherbit offers a [set of icons](https://www.weatherbit.io/api/codes) to
represent the current conditions. Using the `current.weather.icon` field, we
can build a url for the corresponding icon.

```
https://www.weatherbit.io/static/img/icons/${code}.png
```

Add an `Image` component to the `Display` component. Make it 120x120.

```js
<Image
  source={{uri: `ICON_URL_HERE`}}
  style={styles.icon} />
```

## Getting local

Hardcoding a postal code works for testing the API, but we're on mobile devices
with geolocation sensors. Let's use those to retrieve more accurate
weather.

React Native includes a polyfill for the browser
[navigator.geolocation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/geolocation.html)
API. It abstracts over the iOS and Android specific calls. When using
`geolocation`, the user will be prompted for location access.

```js
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
  position => console.log(position),
  err => console.error(err),
  {timeout: 2000}
)
```

`getCurrentPosition` is asynchronous, and it takes 2 callbacks, one for a
success, and another for failure. On success, `position.coords` holds the
`latitude` and `logitude` of our current position.

**Note:** The `timeout` is necessary for the in-browser emulator. The emulated
device waits to resolve a position, causing neither success or failure
callbacks to get called. The timeout forces the error callback to get invoked
after 2 seconds.  Shim it by returning an default position of American Fork:

```js
{coords: { latitude: 40.4, longitude: -111.8 }};
```

Weatherbit has a
[/current](https://www.weatherbit.io/api#!/Current32Weather32Data/get_current)
endpoint that supports `lat` and `lon`.
Change your `fetch` call to use it instead of postal code.

```
https://api.weatherbit.io/v1.0/current?key=${key}&units=I&lat=${position.coords.latitude}&lon=${position.coords.longitude}
```

## Stats for nerds

The weather API returns various other stats that our app can list below the
title. Create a `Stat` component to show a stat like *Wind Direction* on the
left and *SW* on the right. `flexDirection: row` and `flex: 1` will help with
this.

```js
const Stat = ({ title, value }) => (
  <View style={styles.stat}>
    <Text style={styles.statTitle}>{title}</Text>
    <Text>{value}</Text>
  </View>
);
```

Add a few stats to a `<View>` styled with `flex: 1` in the `App` component

```js
<View style={styles.stats}>
  <Stat title="Wind Direction" value={current.wind_cdir} />
  <Stat title="Wind Speed" value={`${current.wind_spd} MPH`} />
  <Stat title="Visibility" value={current.visibility} />
  <Stat title="Pressure" value={`${current.pres} Hg`} />
  <Stat title="Humidity" value={`${current.rh}%`} />
  <Stat title="Timezone" value={current.timezone} />
</View>
```

## Scroll

Did you notice that the stats list isn't scrollable? When in React Native, you
explicitly choose when something should scroll by using the `ScrollView`
component.

Import it and replace the `<View>` from the last step with `<ScrollView>`.

**Congrats!** you've built a basic cross-platform, location-aware, realtime
weather app.

# Extras

## Making promises

`navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` is awkward because it is callback
based. We can wrap it with a Promise to take advantage of Promise chaining.

```js
const getPosition = options => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(resolve, reject, options);
});
```

This promise will resolve when a position is successfully found and reject when
an error occurs.

It now allows us to write readable async code as follows:

```js
getPosition({timeout: 2000})
  .catch(() => ({coords: { latitude: 40.4, longitude: -111.8 }}))
  .then(position => fetch(...))
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(json => {
    this.setState({current: json.data[0]});
  });
```

## They don't stop

While looking up location and making a request, a loading spinner can improve
the user experience over a blank screen.

React Native includes a built-in `ActivityIndicator` component. Import it, and
render it while `state.current` is null.

```js
if (!state.current) {
  return <ActivityIndicator size="large" style={{flex: 1}} />
}
```
